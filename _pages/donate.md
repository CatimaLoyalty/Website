# Donate to CATIMA

<p id="why-donate-to-catima" style="font-size: 2.3rem;font-family:Merriweather, serif;">First off, thanks for considering donating to Catima. We really appreciate that you want to support Catima development.</p>


<p style="font-size: 2.3rem;font-family:Merriweather, serif;">However, before you make your payment, please read the following:</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <p style="font-size: 2rem;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don’t donate if you can’t afford what you’re spending.</span>
            Catima is a passion project.
            <!-- I’m lucky enough to have a well-paid job and I don’t need this money, and it’s the same for most of the team.  -->
            So don’t donate if it will take something away from you.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p style="font-size: 2rem;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The team appreciate your donation, but it will not give you any entitlement.</span>
            Feature development will happen depending on community feedback, and saying “I donated to Catima” will not increase the likelihood of us working on a particular feature. 
            Once again, this is a passion project driven by the community, not by money!
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

<p style="font-size: 2.3rem;font-family:Merriweather, serif;">If you still want to donate after reading all of the above—thank you so much!</p>

# How will your money be used?

<p style="font-size: 2.3rem;font-family:Merriweather, serif;">
While Catima also has very little costs (currently only the catima.app domain), 
   Catima also doesn't have any third-party contributors who want to be paid
   (yet? who knows what the future brings) and it definitely doesn't relate to third-world country stuff 
   (although I do try to keep Catima lean-and-green and working well on old devices). 
   Donations for Catima are more a "thank you" than anything else, 
   so it would be important for people to not think that their money will be used to do something great 
   (if we do ever get contributors in the future who want to be paid and will create good enough stuff that it's worth it, 
   I can update the text myself)
