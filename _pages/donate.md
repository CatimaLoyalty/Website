# Donate to Catima

Thank you for considering donating to Catima!

Before donating, please read the following:

- **Please don't donate if you can't afford it.** Catima is a passion project first and foremost. Donations allow you to show your appreciation for the project, but they are not necessary for Catima to keep existing.
- **Please don't expect anything in return.** While we appreciate the support, donors should not expect anything in return; donating will not result in any kind of special or priority treatment for bug reports or feature requests. Community feedback is the main driver of development, along with a desire to keep Catima simple, accessible, and power-efficient.

If you still want to donate after reading the above, thank you! You can do so via either [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/TheLastProject) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/sylviavanos).
