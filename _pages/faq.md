# Frequently asked questions

## What is Catima's business model? How does it make money?

Catima is a hobby project made to give users a way to store loyalty cards and other barcode-based cards without having their private data sold. It is fully offline and doesn't send your data to any server. Please be aware that [Google will make encrypted backups of apps on their servers by default](https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582).

Making money is not a goal of the Catima project. Giving users a privacy-friendly alternative to other loyalty card apps is.

## Do you accept donations?

If you feel like donating as a thank you, I accept donations through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/TheLastProject) and [PayPal](https://paypal.me/sylviavanos). But please do not feel pressured to :)

## I don't like the new version, how do I downgrade?

Every release ever made is available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CatimaLoyalty/Android/releases). Choose the version you want and download the attached .apk file.

Do note that Android does not allow downgrading apps and requires you to uninstall the current version you have installed. To prevent data loss, make sure you export your database before your uninstall.
