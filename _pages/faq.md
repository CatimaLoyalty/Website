# Frequently asked questions

## I don't like the new version, how do I downgrade?

Every release ever made is available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CatimaLoyalty/Android/releases). Choose the version you want and download the attached .apk file.

Do note that Android does not allow downgrading apps and requires you to uninstall the current version you have installed. To prevent data loss, make sure you export your database before your uninstall.
