# How To Contribute

The Catima project accepts third party contributions. When contributing, please be aware that Catima is currently maintained by one person in her spare time so it may take some time to get to your contribution.

## Reporting Bugs

Please use the [Catima issue tracker](https://github.com/CatimaLoyalty/Android/issues) to report issues.

When using the issue tracker, please first use the search bar to see if your issue has already been reported and otherwise use the green "New issue" button on the top right.

## Translating

You can help translate Catima on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/catima/).

Please note that Weblate does not shield your email address. If this is a concern to you, please use a throwaway email.

## Developing

Catima's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CatimaLoyalty/Android). It is licensed under the GPL version 3.0 (or any later version).
